NavigationDrawerActionBarCompat
===============================

NavigationDrawer using the official release of ActionBarCompat.

In order to use this as a starter app, you'll have to simply import the ActionBarComp library found in the latest version of the SDK (at this time it is API level 18).

Steps to import the library (using eclipse, others should be similar):

1) Import... existing Android code into workspace

2) Select the directory where the library exists
        ../sdk/extras/android/support/v7/appcompat
        
3) Copy projects into workspace (optional)

4) Finish

In your project:
    Properties | Android | make sure "android-support-v7-appcompat" is added as a library, if not, add it.
    
That's it!
